# BotIntelligenceEmulator
The Bot Intelligence Emulator simulates a real-time meeting intelligence service that does the following:

- Receives Live Transcript Data by listening in on a WebSocket server for incoming transcript chunks from meetings. 
- Processes Transcripts in batches for efficient processing
- Analyzes meeting content and generates helpful context using OpenAI GPT model. 

The emulator automatically identifies what the meeting is about from a predefined list of common meeting topics. It can suggest up to three relevant technical documentation links based on the context discussed. Any known acronyms are automatically detected and a definition is provided, with AI-generated definitions for any unknown definitions. 

This is just the surface. The nice thing about this is that it can be extended with different modules/agents (eg. Private Repositories, Private team dashboards, etc)
