    "Speaker": "Manager",
    "Transcript": "Yesterday I finalized the SOW and drafted the OKRs. Today I’m grooming the Jira backlog and locking down KPI and SLA targets with Product. No blockers."

    "Speaker": "Dev1",
    "Transcript": "Yesterday I completed the React UI scaffold and opened a PR. Today I’ll integrate the Auth API and start Cypress tests. Blocker: need Dev2’s code review by EOD."

    "Speaker": "Dev2",
    "Transcript": "Yesterday I provisioned the VPC and ECS cluster via Terraform. Today I’m containerizing the core service and wiring it into the CI/CD pipeline. Blocker: waiting on IAM-policy approval."
